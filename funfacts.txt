Solitaire is a family of games, of which the most common game, Klondike, is just one of many!
Solitaire is the US/Canadian name, which became more popular than Patience, the original European name.
Patience is probably of German or Scandinavian origin, with the earliest records appearing there in the late 1700s and early 1800s.
The earliest known description of a game of Patience appeared in the 1783 edition of the German game anthology Das neue Königliche L'Hombre-Spiel, where it is called Patience and describes a game between two players playing alternately.
This is Klondike!
The origins of the name Klondike are unknown...
A game of Klondike has 4 possible card positions: Tableau, Stock, Waste, and Foundation!
The probability of being able to win a game of Klondike with best-possible play is not known, and the inability of theoreticians to precisely calculate these odds has been referred to by mathematician Persi Diaconis as "one of the embarrassments of applied probability".
The probability of winning Thoughtful Klondike (with draw three rules) has been estimated at 81.942% ± 0.081%.
Sometimes it is impossible to know the best moves!
Klondike has been turned into a gambling game by playing with the rule of dealing cards one at a time and going through the stock once. Payout is calculated for the number of cards played to the foundations.
Microsoft has included Solitaire since Windows 3.0.
Lost business productivity by employees playing Solitaire has become a common concern.
In 2020, it was estimated that the game still had 35 million active monthly players and more than 100 million games played daily.
The Klondike is also a region of the territory of Yukon, in northwestern Canada, where the Klondike Gold Rush happened.
The original Windows Solitaire was made by an intern called Wes Cherry.
Microsoft estimates that over 35 billion games of Klondike have been played worldwide.
